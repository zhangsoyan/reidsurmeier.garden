# [file.gallery](https://file.gallery/)

germinate a website from files, directories, and .DS_Store.

file.gallery is [sisters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_city)
with [kevin.garden](https://github.com/inchkev/garden).


## guide

in the root directory, run `npm run cultivate`.

```console
$ npm run cultivate
how do we turn a directory into a garden?
usage:      node cultivate.js DIR
options:    -h, --help       print help
```

the cultivate script reads all the files in your directory and traverses
directories up to a certain depth, and creates an `index.html` file displaying
the contents of every directory it visits.

there are two ways the script can display a directory: *natural* and *formal*.
- *formal* is the default. in the formal arrangement, files are sorted
lexicographically by file name and displayed in a tight grid.
- *natural* arranges files by their "physical" location (as shown in the finder
directory). to allow this, the directory must be set to "Sort By > None", *and*
you must have moved every file at least once.

add files, move them around, run `npm run cultivate`, rinse and repeat.

### capabilities

**for each file,**

- file types that have direct html equivalents (\<img\>, \<video\>, \<audio\>)
are displayed using those tags. supported file extensions:
  - *images*: jpeg, png, webp, gif, apng, svg, bmp, ico
  - *videos*: mp4, webm
  - *audio*: mp3, wav, ogg, m4a
- markdown (md) files are parsed into pretty html.
- all other file types are shown as direct links with no display formatting.
- a file with no extension has its contents shown. these are good to use as
headers.

**in a directory,**

- arranges based on file positions, if every file has been moved
- mirrors a directory's background color (only works for solid colors). if the
background is dark enough, the text color will be set to white.
- recursively traverses sub-directories, up to three directories deep from
where the script was run. be careful - this can generate a lot of index.html
files if run in a large directory.

**special files,**

- .gardenignore specifies a list of files/directories that is ignored by the
cultivation script. add files here that you explicitly want to be hidden.
- (.gitignore does the same, but is used to hide extraneous system files.)
- .DS_Store is esteemed

### what does .DS_Store hold?

in every directory interfaced through the finder app, macos stores
finder-specific metadata in the .DS_Store file. normally hidden from view,
.DS_Store stores directory settings such as file positions, icon size, background
color, sort order, etc.

I have found that the best way to make the .DS_Store file update its metadata
is to delete the generated `index.html` file in the directory you made changes.
deleting a file seems to be a reliable way to trigger an update to the metadata
stored in the .DS_Store file.


## setup

1. clone this repository, or download everything as a .zip and unzip it.

2. install node.js and npm. to check if they are already installed, you should
be able to run `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal without seeing errors. if
they're not installed, you can follow the official instructions
[here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) or 
get it through [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) via `brew install node`.

3. install python 3. check if you already have it installed: `python3 --version`.
to install via homebrew: `brew install python`.

4. open a terminal and navigate to this repository's directory. run `npm -i`.
you're ready to go.

5. the minimum set of files you'll need to keep is `package.json`, `.gitignore`,
`.gardenignore`, the `src` directory, and the `views` directory. `src` contains
the script that generates the website, and `views` contains the html templates
that format each page.


## what's changed

- 4/26/25:
  - performance enhancements, parallelize async operations
  - sort order is now name localeAware, might affect some display orders.
  previously, it was in the order readdir() returned
- 2/16/25: tweaked `formal.ejs` to be a bit less formal
- 4/12/24: add text-size-adjust (and webkit equiv)
- 4/8/24: for markdown files,
  - display file size
  - add `md` class to divs, add margins to inner tags
- 10/17/23: added gray border around items
- 10/9/23: added max recursion depth argument, defaults to 3
- 10/6/23: you can `node cultivate.js DIR` now!
  - just be very careful what directory you specify...

### todos

- add max recursion depth as a parameter for the script. today, the max depth
is set to 3. you can change this directly in the script 


## license

- `src/` — `cultivate.js` is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
  - if modified, indicate it by adding it to the header comment, e.g. "modified by \[name\]: add jpeg xl support"
  - the `LICENSE` file only needs to be displayed on the website if `cultivate.js` (or the entire `src/` directory) is published as well, as is the case currently. if you add the `src/` directory to the `.gardenignore` list, you may hide `LICENSE` as well.
- `src/` — `parse.py` by [Thomas Zhu](https://github.com/hanwenzhu) is licensed under the MIT license.
- `views/` — all templates and their styles are licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).
  - if modified, indicate it in the attribution, e.g. "modified by \[name\]"
- the license for site content (published images, text, etc) should be described on the website itself.

### attribution

for published websites, having the CC (creative commons) attribution only in the html source is sufficient. it's already there in the bottom of the .ejs template files. i'd also appreciate if the link to either https://kevin.garden/ or https://file.gallery/ were kept in the attribution text. a visible reference on the website itself would be nice too, although optional.

thank you!
